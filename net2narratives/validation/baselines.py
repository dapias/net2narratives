baselines.py -- Net2Narratives: deterministic template baseline.

Given only the network dictionary (meta/nodes/edges) that the LLM also
receives, this module renders one sentence per edge ("A and B have a
{band} {sign} partial correlation (r = {weight})."), using the protocol's
magnitude bands; one sentence per community (including single-node
communities); and one sentence per node whose positive and negative edges
largely offset, calling it the most connected node only if it has the
highest strength. It never reads a test's ground truth. Absent edges are
described as zero by construction for constructed networks and as "not
retained" for estimated ones (those with meta.n).

Because every statement is computed directly from the supplied numbers, the
template cannot invent edges, misstate signs or magnitude bands, or use
causal language. Scoring it with the same evaluator therefore checks that
each competency's criterion can be satisfied from the supplied network,
i.e. that a perfect score is attainable by construction (paper,
Appendix A.2). No API access is needed.

Usage (matching the paper's benchmark settings):
    python3 -m net2narratives.validation.baselines --source both \
        --n-per-competency 21 --seed 4242 --out-dir baseline_results
