# export_bfi_network.R -- builds network_for_llm.json from the public,
# built-in psych::bfi (25-item Big Five Inventory) dataset, for use as a
# second, genuinely public real-network external-validation case study
# alongside Bereznowski et al. 2023 (see empirical_networks/work_strain_engagement/).
#
# DATA SOURCE: psych::bfi is bundled directly in the R psych/psychTools
# package (Revelle, W. psych: Procedures for Psychological, Psychometric,
# and Personality Research. Northwestern University. https://CRAN.R-
# project.org/package=psych) -- no external data file, no access request.
#
# GROUND TRUTH CHOICE: the five-factor item groupings (Agreeableness,
# Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness) are used as the
# THEORETICAL/a priori community structure -- baked into the item design
# itself (bfi's own documented scoring key), NOT walktrap-detected. This is
# a firmer ground truth than Bereznowski's stochastic spin-glass communities,
# and it asks a sharper question of the LLM: can it recover a community
# structure it may already "know" from prior training (Big Five is
# extremely well-known), or does the same collapsing/merging failure found
# on Bereznowski's less culturally salient clusters show up regardless?
#
# REVERSE-KEYING: A1, C4, C5, E1, E2, O2, O5 are reverse-scored on the 1-6
# scale, per the psych package's own documented scoring key (bfi.keys;
# https://rdrr.io/cran/psych/man/bfi.html, verified 2026-08-25). Applied
# BEFORE estimation so all edges reflect "higher = more of the named
# construct," matching network_for_llm.json's schema requirement.
#
# ESTIMATION: qgraph::cor_auto() (polychoric, appropriate for 6-point
# ordinal items) + qgraph::EBICglasso(gamma=0.5, threshold=TRUE) -- the
# same correlation + regularization combination bootnet::estimateNetwork(
# default="EBICglasso") uses internally. bootnet itself wasn't installable
# in the sandbox that authored this script (no CRAN network access there),
# so this calls the same two underlying functions directly. If you have
# bootnet available, feel free to swap in
# bootnet::estimateNetwork(df_complete, default="EBICglasso", threshold=TRUE)
# for closer parity with how export_bereznowski_network.R called it for
# Bereznowski -- results should be numerically identical, same defaults.
#
# ADMISSIBILITY: cor_auto()'s forcePD correction is checked explicitly
# below (not silently applied) -- see step 2 -- and logged, matching the
# positive-definiteness discipline used elsewhere in this project (procedural
# networks are checked and rejected outright if not admissible; here, since
# this is a fixed empirical case study rather than a generated network, we
# report whether correction was needed rather than rejecting).
#
# expected_influence/strength_centrality are derived directly from the
# estimated edge matrix by THIS script, not sourced from any published
# paper -- flagged as such in meta.method, same convention as
# export_bereznowski_network.R used for Bereznowski.
#
# OUTPUT LOCATION: network_for_llm.json, the figure, and the
# sessionInfo capture are all written to THIS SCRIPT's own directory (via
# .get_script_dir()), not R's working directory -- a bare relative
# filename like "network_for_llm.json" would otherwise land wherever
# R's cwd happens to be at call time (e.g. the repo root, if run via
# RStudio's Source button or `Rscript` from elsewhere), not necessarily
# next to this script.
